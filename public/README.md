# What can I do with it?

- Send completely anonymous `messages` or `replies`
    - with `attachments`
        - with `spoilers`
    - and `custom usernames`
    - and `custom PFPs`
        - that are either `statis`: stay same
        - or are `dynamic`: evolve based on usernames 
            - with different selectable styles
- `Report` anonymous messages or replies
- `Ban` users from sending anonymous messages
    - either `automatically` after a set number of `reports`
    - or `manually` by message or reply reference
- Have `Admin Logs`
    - `global`
    - or different for each channel
- Have custom `Anon Profiles`: PFPs and usernames

> Whatever latency you saw ðŸ‘†here while "Sending command..." is due to Discord's slow (file) upload speeds.
> The Anon message is sent back almost instantaneously after the data reaches Anonymity.

> Anonymity, under `no` circumstance, will reveal your true identity to Admins/Moderators. \
> However Admins/Moderators `can` ban you from using Anonymity in their server using [`/user-ban-settings`](#user-ban-settings). \
> Or if you're reported using [`/report-anon-user`](#report-anon-user) more than a set number of times (21 by default), you'll be autobanned from using Anonymity server-wide.

# How do I set it up in my server?

> This section is only for server Admins/Moderators. \
> You at least need the `Kick Members` permission in a server to be considered an Admin/Moderator in that server.
